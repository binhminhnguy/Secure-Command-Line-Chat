# Secure-Command-Line-Chat
 In an era where digital communication is prevalent, ensuring privacy and security is more crucial, especially when people nowadays tend to communicate remotely. There are various aspects of security technology that we can implement more functions to advance. I will choose command line chat, which is a simple, text-based messaging tool that lets users send and receive messages directly from the command line or terminal. Although efficient, this application lacks internal security measures such as encryption and authentication that can cause unauthorized access. 
     This project undertakes the improvement in that respect and looks to integrate encryption directly into the communication of the command line chat. This solution will implement the Vigenère Cipher, a classical method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, to provide a simple but effective method that secures user messages. The client and server have one keyword with which they interchangeably encrypt or decrypt each message, so that only those with the correct key may interpret the conversation. This solution is proposed not only to enhance the users' privacy but also to give meaning to secure even the most simple forms of communication. 
      To set up secure communication between a server and a client, I will establish a connection and start listening to messages from the client. As soon as the client sends a message, the server receives it and encrypts the content to ensure security. If the decryption key used by the server doesn't match the client's encryption key, the message will appear as “violating”, making it unreadable. This mismatch helps verify the authenticity of the message, allowing only properly encrypted messages to be fully understood.
